## 🚀 About The Project

**Jomato** is an unofficial, reverse-engineered client for Zomato. It is designed to provide utility features that power users need but the official app doesn't prioritize.

### 🍕 Key Feature: Instant Food Rescue Notifications

The "Food Rescue" initiative is great for saving money and preventing waste, but the deals vanish in seconds.

**Jomato solves this:**
* **Real-time Monitoring:** Jomato listens for Food Rescue events in your area.
* **Instant Alerts:** Get a notification the *second* a restaurant lists a rescue basket.
* **Direct Access:** Tap the notification to jump straight to the deal (before it sells out).

## 📥 How to Install

Since Jomato is an unofficial tool and not on the Google Play Store, your phone will try to block the installation. **This is normal.**

1.  **Download the APK:**
    * Go to the [**Releases Page**](../../releases).
    * Download the latest file (e.g., `Jomato-v1.0.apk`).

2.  **Open the File:**
    * Tap the downloaded file to install.

3.  **Bypass Play Protect:**
    * You will likely see a scary pop-up saying **"Unsafe App Blocked"** or **"Unknown Developer"**.
    * Click **"More Details"** (or the small arrow).
    * Click **"Install Anyway"**.

> **Note:** This warning appears because the app is signed with a personal key and hasn't been reviewed by Google. The code is open source here for you to verify.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Android:** Native Android (Kotlin/Java)
* **Network:** Retrofit / OkHttp for API interception
* **Architecture:** Reverse-engineered Zomato Internal API
