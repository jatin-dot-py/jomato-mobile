## About The Project

Jomato is an unofficial, reverse-engineered client for Zomato. It delivers utility features that enhance user experience beyond the official app's offerings, focusing on capabilities not readily available or promoted.

### Features

- **Instant Food Rescue Notifications**: Monitors Food Rescue events in real time within your area. Delivers immediate alerts upon listing of a rescue basket by a restaurant. Allows direct access to the deal via notification tap, ensuring timely acquisition before depletion.

## How to Install

Jomato is an unofficial application not available on the Google Play Store, which may trigger security warnings during installation. This is expected behavior.

1. **Download the APK**:
   - Navigate to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/jatin-dot-py/jomato-mobile/releases).
   - Select and download the latest file, such as `Jomato-v1.0.apk`.

2. **Open the File**:
   - Tap the downloaded file to begin installation.

3. **Bypass Play Protect**:
   - A warning may appear indicating "Unsafe App Blocked" or "Unknown Developer."
   - Select "More Details" or the equivalent option.
   - Proceed by choosing "Install Anyway."

Note: This warning occurs due to the app's personal key signature and lack of Google review. The source code is publicly available in this repository for verification.
